# Effect-of-AWGN-on-QPSK-modulation
This project was a collaborative effort undertaken by my classmates and me as part of our coursework in the "Analog and Digital Communications" class. The primary objective of the assignment was to assess our understanding of key communication system concepts, so our instructor assigned each group a specific topic aligned with their group number. Our group was tasked with exploring and analyzing the relationship between Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) and Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK)â€”two fundamental elements in modern digital communications.

To begin, we conducted a concise yet comprehensive review of the theoretical foundations of both AWGN and QPSK, ensuring that our knowledge of these core concepts was clear and up to date. We then shifted our focus toward the practical aspects of QPSK communication, specifically examining its transmission and reception processes within a typical digital communication system. Following this, we investigated how AWGN impacts the performance of QPSK modulation, highlighting the degradation in signal quality and bit error rates under noisy conditions.

To further illustrate these concepts in a tangible and visual manner, we implemented simulations using MATLAB. These simulations allowed us to demonstrate and analyze the influence of AWGN on QPSK signal performance under varying noise intensities, thereby solidifying our theoretical understanding with practical insights.
